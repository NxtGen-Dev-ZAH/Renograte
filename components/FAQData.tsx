  },
  {
    question: "How does a RENOGRATE® transaction work?",
    answer: "Buyers receive a renovation allowance determined by the property's post-renovation value. Sellers effectively provide a short-term loan via the RENOGRATE® Option Agreement that provides control of the property to the buyer ahead of the closing date, allowing the buyer to undertake the work at home. After renovations, the property is purchased at an agreed price, and the contract is paid at closing. All facilitated through RENOGRATE®'s platform."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if the seller changes their mind?",
    answer: "If a seller changes their mind during a RENOGRATE® transaction, they remain responsible for the renovations and must pay the contractor for the work. The Contractor Service Agreement allows the contractor to place a lien on the property if necessary."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if the buyer changes their mind?",
    answer: "If the buyer changes their mind or can't close on the property, the buyer typically forfeits their earnest money deposit to the seller. The seller, then, has the option to list their newly renovated home on the market. It's important to note that the contractor involved in the renovation gets paid at closing, ensuring that they receive compensation for the work done."
  },
  {
    question: "Does buyer renovations before closing increase the length of sale compared to seller renovations before listing?",
    answer: "No, the same amount of time that a seller would typically wait to renovate their home before listing it for sale is essentially the same length of time for a buyer who chooses to RENOGRATE® it before closing. The renovation process doesn't significantly impact the overall length of the sale."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the cost to complete a RENOGRATE® transaction?",
    answer: "There is no out-of-pocket expense to the buyer or seller. Realtors pay an annual subscription fee to use the proprietary platform, and contractors can sign up for the RENOGRATE® platform and pay an annual fee as preferred vendors. A RENOGRATE® transaction fee of $499 is paid at closing."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if the property does not appraise for the agreed upon after renovated value?",
    answer: "The RENOGRATE® Option Agreement includes contingencies to handle appraisal challenges. This may involve renegotiating the purchase price, with the buyer or seller agreeing to pay the difference or splitting it between both parties, much like in a traditional real estate transaction. Agents can manage this process effectively."
  },
  {
    question: "How does the Renograte Calculator work?",
    answer: "The Renograte Calculator uses input values such as the current home price, desired ARV, and renovation costs to compute the renovation allowance. This tool guides users in planning their budget and ensures renovations are financially viable."
  },
